# Raster_Value_Extraction_WA
Raster Value Extraction tool, web app version

By Grant Haynes

This is a Python script meant to be used as a script tool in ArcMap to extract raster values at a given point or points. This was written in Python 2.7 and used successfully on ArcMap 10.6.

Note:
    This tool was simplified from a python toolbox to a script to to allow for better implementation on arcGIS for Server.
